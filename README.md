Dr. Frederic Marazzato

I'm an Assistant Professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
I specialize in Computational Mathematics and more specifically in Finite Element Methods for nonlinear problems (often deriving from nonlinear mechanics).
I have a keen interest in fracture and metametarials, especially the ones made with origami patterns.
